# servo_PCA9685
A custom version from the Adafruit library that works with many cpu's included ESP8266.
The adafruit library doesn't work out of the box, it contains also some unused code and it's pretty old, unfortunatly the rarely update libraries (some pull request rely for years) and I need to use this chip so I wroted a compatible library just for servo's that works with any CPU I have (included ESP8266) and...voil√†.
Have fun!
